## Business proposal

> App that allows monitoring of emergency situations from public transport vehicle cameras

- The vehicle streams to server -> it gets analyzed for emergency situations (crashes…)
- When crash is identified a notification pops up, alerting the dispatcher
- The dispatcher analyzes the situation (camera recording, location, other metrics…) and possibly alerts the emergency services prompting a faster response.
